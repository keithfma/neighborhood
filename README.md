# Neighborhood Algorithm Optimization and Ensemble Appraisal 

Python 3 implementation of "neighborhood algorithm" direct-search optimization
and Bayesian ensemble appraisal. In short, a nearest-neighbor interpolant based
on Voronoi polygons is used to interpolate the misfit (search) and posterior
probability (appraisal) to allow efficient sampling and integration for
high-dimensional problems. Details on theory and implementation are supplied in
